# This face detection software it is still in develpment. It has a lot of flaws that needs to be emprove,
# since there's no implementation of machine learning/deep learning. 
# This program was written using OpenCV by Intel + their haarcasced availible(https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/754941) also by Intel.
# Another importan resource that made this possible was The Viola Jones algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework).
# The viola jones algorithm is pretty much a machine learning approach 
# face-detection
